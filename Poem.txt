To a wonderful father whose impact will always be felt.

The father I never got the chance to write a poem about as soon as he died.

Could it because of my naivety or because I was scared and do not  know what the world has in stuck for me?

Could it because I was young? No! It was because words alone could not express what I felt then. 

A father like no other!

A confidant!

A hero I watched as I go and take the path of life.

My mentor who continually remind me of my Creator and supports me on this path.
 
Oh my father!

Who answers my imaginative questions without getting bored.

Oh my father!

May Allah forgive your sins and grant you the highest place in Paradise.  Aamin
